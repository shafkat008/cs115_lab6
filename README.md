## How to Submit the Exercise

**The lab 6 assignment is due during your lab session the week of Oct. 12 - 15.**

You have to provide two submissions for each lab exercise: 
<br>
<br>
**1. Please submit your attempt of the lab exercise in UR Courses at the start of your regularly scheduled lab time.** We expect you to prepare for your lab by modifying the sample code as demonstrated in the videos. This attempt will be marked based on your ability to follow the demonstration (more details are on UR Courses).
<br>
<br>
**2. Please submit the final version of your replit project in the CS 115 Lab Replit Team before the oral exam time during your lab session.** You must submit the final replit project before the lab session ends, regardless of whether or not you have an exam booked. If you do not submit your replit project to the CS 115 Lab Replit Team, you will receive a zero on the corresponding oral exam.
